## Installation

### First Time Setup
Vencord isn't modular, so you'll need to build from source to add custom plugins. Check out this guide to get started: https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/

### How to Install the Plugin
1. Open your terminal and head to the userplugins folder: `cd src/userplugins`  Might have to create it if not there
2. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/shxdes69/vencord-animated-Status
```
3. Rebuild Vencord following the instructions in the Vencord documentation.

### How to Update the Plugin
To grab the latest features and bug fixes, update the plugin by running:
```
cd src/userplugins/vencord-animated-Status
git pull
```
Then rebuild Vencord as needed.
